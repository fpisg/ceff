### Fibers are not threads

As stated before, fibers are like "light" threads, meaning they can be used in
a similar way than threads to create concurrent code. However, they are not
threads and that means that spawning new fibers does not guarantee that the
action described in the `F` associated to it will be run if there is a shortage
of threads. At the end of the day, if no thread is available that can run, then
the actions in that fiber will be blocked untill some thread is free again.

### When is `async` useful then?

The `Async` type class is useful specially when the task to rub by the `F` can
be terminated by any thread. For example, calls to remote services are often
modeled with `Future`s so they do not block the calling thread. When defining
our `F`, should we block on the `Future` waiting for the result? No ! We can
wrap the call in a `async` call â˜º
